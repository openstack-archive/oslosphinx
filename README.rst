OpenStack Sphinx Extensions
===========================

Theme and extension support for Sphinx documentation from the
OpenStack project.

To use the theme, add ``'oslosphinx'`` to the ``extensions`` list in
the ``conf.py`` file in your Sphinx project.

If you are an incubating project, set:

``html_theme_options = {'incubating': True}`` in your conf.py as well, to enable the Incubation theme.
